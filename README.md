## web-abap2UI5

**Live demo: [abap2ui5.github.io/web-abap2UI5-build](https://abap2ui5.github.io/web-abap2UI5-build/)** — the
complete abap2UI5 backend, downported, transpiled to JavaScript and running
inside your browser tab. No server, no SAP system.

The build is **frozen**: abap2UI5, samples, the open-abap libraries and the
UI5 release are pinned in [ci/pins.json](ci/pins.json), there is no scheduled
rebuild, and the demo only changes when this repository does. It is
deployed to [web-abap2UI5-build](https://github.com/abap2UI5/web-abap2UI5-build)
(GitHub Pages). Contributor and agent guidance lives in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

### Functionality
* Downporting with [abaplint](https://abaplint.org/)
* Transpiling to JS with [abaplint/transpiler](https://github.com/abaplint/transpiler)
* Running on Node.js with [open-abap](https://github.com/open-abap/open-abap)
* Service exposing via [express-icf-shim](https://github.com/open-abap/express-icf-shim)
* Running the same backend **in the browser**: webpack bundles the transpiled
  ABAP into one script and [sql.js](https://sql.js.org/) (SQLite compiled to
  wasm) stands in for the database, so the demo needs no server at all — it is
  a static GitHub Pages site

### Tasks
##### Downport & Transpile
```
npm run clone
npm run build
```
##### Run Unit Tests
```
npm test          # clone once, then: downport + transpile + unit tests
npm run test:unit # only the transpiled unit tests, on an existing ./output
```
`npm test` is exactly what CI runs as "the tests".

##### Run Webservice
The transpiled backend on Node.js, served by express on port 3000. Started by
hand — it is not part of any test run:
```
npm run serve:express
```

##### Webpack Build Strategy

1. Clone repositories into /src/
2. Downport /src/ into /downport/
3. Transpile with express-icf-shim into /output/
4. Webpack backend + database into folder build

```
npm run build:web
```

The bundle contains no static frontend copy: at runtime `app/web.mjs` initializes the transpiled backend, issues an in-memory HTTP GET against it (the same `z2ui5_cl_http_handler` GET that serves real systems, including the `sap.ui.require.preload` of the complete current UI5 frontend) and `document.write`s the returned page. Frontend and backend are therefore always the versions cloned that day. The backend's Content-Security-Policy meta tag is stripped from the written page — it is designed for server-served deployments (no `unsafe-eval`/`wasm-unsafe-eval`) and would break the wasm/eval-based in-browser runtime while protecting nothing here.

Test the build locally (webpack-dev-server HMR does not work with the `document.write` boot):

```
npm run serve:build
```

### Media Pipeline

Record any abap2UI5 app as video and screenshot — post-ready assets for
LinkedIn, docs and READMEs:

```
npm run media -- --app <app-class>
```

By default this records the app on the published web build above; `--url`
points it at any other page that starts apps via `?app_start=` (a local
`serve:build`, a real system). `--steps <file>` replays a scripted
interaction ([media/steps.example.json](media/steps.example.json)), `--size`
switches between desktop, phone and tablet viewports. Output per app:
`.webm` and `.png` always, `.mp4` (what LinkedIn ingests best) and `.gif`
when ffmpeg is installed. [media/record.mjs](media/record.mjs) documents
all options, including offline recording via `--ui5-from`.

### CI
The `build_web` workflow runs on every push to main (and deploys), on pull requests and by hand — there is no schedule: it clones [abap2UI5](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5) and the top-level apps of [samples](https://github.com/abap2UI5/samples), runs downport, transpile, unit tests and the webpack build, then **smoke tests the built site in a real browser** before deploying it to [web-abap2UI5-build](https://github.com/abap2UI5/web-abap2UI5-build) (GitHub Pages). Every clone is the commit pinned in `ci/pins.json`, so a rerun of the same commit builds the same demo.

The browser gate is the one that matters: everything upstream of it can be green while the deployed page is blank, because a bundling or initialization fault only shows when the bundle actually runs. `tests/web.spec.js` loads the freshly built `./build`, waits for the in-browser backend to answer, and asserts an event roundtrip restores the saved draft. Before it existed, the site deployed completely untested.

```
npm run build:web   # build ./build
npm run test:e2e    # the same gate, locally (playwright, project chromium-web)
```

`@abaplint/cli` is pinned to the version used by abap2UI5 itself, since the downport result must pass the same syntax check — at the pinned abap2UI5 commit. There is no Dependabot: `package-lock.json` decides every npm version.

The deploy is a **production** webpack build. Two Terser defaults have to be turned off for it (`keep_classnames`, `keep_fnames`) because the transpiled ABAP carries its type system in the class and function names that RTTI reads back — see the comment in `webpack.config.js`.

The deployed site is not only the bundle: `app/pages/` (README, 404 page) and
this repository's `LICENSE` are copied into `./build` before the deploy, and
the build's provenance is written as `BUILD_INFO.json`. The deploy runs with `force_orphan: true`, so anything
committed in the artifact repository by hand is gone with the next run — every
file that should be there has to be produced here.

### Limitations & Todo
* Samples in subfolders of the samples repository (system samples, launchpad samples) are excluded — they require a real SAP system and cannot be transpiled
* `src/99` of abap2UI5 (the frozen legacy package) is not part of the build. `clone:core` drops it. Should a sample ever need one of those classes again, the fix belongs in the sample — `src/99` is on abap2UI5's removal plan and will not be there forever
* A known upstream [@abaplint/transpiler](https://github.com/abaplint/transpiler) issue makes `check_on_init( )` always false in the transpiled backend (interface attributes read through an interface-typed reference resolve to a missing JS property), so backend-built view XML may not be returned even though the roundtrip succeeds
