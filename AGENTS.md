# AGENTS.md — web-abap2UI5

Guidance for AI agents and contributors. Single source of truth for this
repository's rules. Read before making any change.

## What this repo is

A build pipeline, not a framework. It clones [abap2UI5](https://github.com/abap2UI5/abap2UI5)
and [samples](https://github.com/abap2UI5/samples), downports them with
abaplint, transpiles them to JavaScript with `@abaplint/transpiler`, and
webpacks the result into a single bundle that runs the **whole backend inside
the browser tab** — sql.js stands in for the database. The `build_web`
workflow deploys it to [web-abap2UI5-build](https://github.com/abap2UI5/web-abap2UI5-build)
(<https://abap2ui5.github.io/web-abap2UI5-build/>).

**The demo is frozen** — see "Frozen inputs" below. It does not follow
upstream any more; it changes only when someone changes this repository.

Nothing under `src/`, `downport/`, `output/`, `build/` is a source file — all
four are gitignored build products. Framework fixes belong upstream in
abap2UI5, not here.

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `ci/` | transpile + downport config, the gates that keep them in lockstep with upstream, and the post-processing patches (below) |
| `srv/` | Node-side entry points: express host, static build server, `ZCL_SICF` |
| `app/` | browser entry: `web.mjs` (boot), `index.html`, `css/`, `pages/` |
| `app/pages/` | README + 404 page copied into the deploy — the artifact repo's own files |
| `tests/web.spec.js` | the browser smoke gate (Playwright project `chromium-web`) |

## Build & test

```bash
npm run clone       # clone:core + clone:samples into ./src
npm test            # build (downport + transpile) + the transpiled unit tests
npm run build:web   # webpack production build into ./build
npm run test:e2e    # the browser smoke against ./build (needs build:web first)
```

`npm test` is exactly what CI runs as the tests — keep it that way. Script
names are namespaced (`clone:*`, `build:*`, `test:*`, `serve:*`); a new script
joins a namespace rather than inventing a bare name.

## Things that look removable and are not

Each of these was paid for with a broken deploy. The full story is in the
comment at the code; this list exists so nobody deletes one without reading it.

- **The `z2ui5_if_exit` copy-back in `clone:core`** (`package.json`). The clone
  drops upstream's frozen `src/99` package, but one object in it is not dead
  weight: `src/01/04/z2ui5_cl_ui5_user_exit` still declares a reference of type
  `z2ui5_if_exit` and its test class still implements the interface, because
  upstream keeps the superseded exit name working while the rename to
  `z2ui5_if_ui5_exit` settles. Deleting the whole package therefore breaks the
  downport with 10 unresolved-type / check_syntax errors — which is what every
  scheduled build did from 2026-08-22 on, the morning after upstream retired
  the interface into `src/99`. The interface (plus the package's
  `package.devc.xml`) is copied back and nothing else; its three types are
  declared AS the ones on `z2ui5_if_ui5_exit`, so it drags no further
  dependency in. When upstream finally deletes `z2ui5_if_exit`, this copy-back
  goes with it.

- **`keep_classnames` / `keep_fnames` in the Terser options**
  (`webpack.config.js`). The transpiled ABAP carries its type system in the
  *names*: RTTI (`describe_by_data` and friends) reads class and function
  names off the generated objects. Mangling them makes RTTI derive types from
  `a` and `s`, and the failure surfaces far away as a `CONVT_NO_NUMBER` out of
  a `class_constructor` during boot — a blank page with one console line. Costs
  ~150 KB of the ~2.9 MB minification saves.

- **Stripping the Content-Security-Policy meta tag** (`app/web.mjs`). The
  backend's CSP is written for server-served deployments (no `unsafe-eval` /
  `wasm-unsafe-eval`). Written into this document it would block the already
  running wasm/eval runtime while protecting nothing — there is no network
  backend in this demo.

- **The Request branch of the fetch override** (`app/web.mjs`). The override
  routes a `fetch()` addressed to this page into the transpiled backend, and it
  has to recognize the target in all three argument shapes the Fetch API takes:
  a string, a `URL` — and a `Request`. The last one is not hypothetical.
  OpenUI5 1.152 ships `sap/ui/performance/FetchInterceptor`, which wraps
  whatever `globalThis.fetch` is when it loads (this override) and always calls
  it as `fetch(new Request(...))`, folding the init object into the request. A
  string-or-URL-only test therefore stopped matching, every backend POST fell
  through to the network and came back as the static server's 404
  `Cannot POST /`: the page booted, rendered nothing and answered no button.
  Nothing in this repository or upstream changed that day — the page boots UI5
  from the *cachebuster* URL, so the CDN flipping to 1.152 was enough to turn
  the same commit red. For the same reason `backendFetch` answers with a real
  `Response` and not a duck-typed look-alike: the interceptor hands the
  returned object to its `onResponse` hooks, which `clone()` it.

- **`ci/patch_diss_oref.mjs`**. `DISS_OREF` resolves attribute chains through
  the *dynamic* type in the transpiler runtime, so `dissolve()` walks from the
  app's `CLIENT` down into the framework core and the draft save clears the
  core app's own `MT_ATTRI` — every follow-up request then dies with "LOOP at
  undefined" on the first button press. The guard skips framework core
  instances only, named class by class: `Z2UI5_CL_UI5_*` as a wildcard would
  also catch the demo *apps*, whose attributes must be dissolved.

- **The abaplint downport shim** (`abap2UI5/node/setup/patch-abaplint-downport.mjs`,
  called from `build:downport` against *this* repo's `@abaplint/cli` bundle).
  Stock abaplint outlines a component-level table expression
  (`tab[ 1 ]-comp`) into a work AREA — a copy — so the row reference is gone
  by the time the framework sees it, and `client->_bind( tab = … tab_index = … )`
  refuses the cell with `BINDING_ERROR_TAB_CELL_LEVEL`. The shim makes the
  outline `ASSIGNING`, which is what the same abaplint rule's write path
  already emits.

  It is upstream's script, run from the clone `clone:core` already makes,
  never a copy: it is a temporary shim for an abaplint defect and it must
  disappear from every consumer on the same day. The bundle path is passed
  explicitly because the clone has no `node_modules` of its own — the default
  would silently patch nothing here.

  The canary is upstream's own `test_bind_tab_cell` (`z2ui5_cl_ui5_client`
  test class), which `npm test` runs: without the shim that test is the one
  red line in an otherwise green suite. That is how this was found — upstream
  added the cell binding on 2026-08-30 and this pipeline, which downports the
  same sources with a different abaplint install, had no shim to apply.

- **`ci/merge_transpile_skips.mjs`, and the empty `skip` array it fills**
  (`ci/abap_transpile.json`). A few abap2UI5 unit tests cannot pass under the
  transpiler — they cover behaviour the NodeJS runtime does not reproduce
  (a dynamic `describe_by_name`, microsecond timestamps, a field-symbol type
  check the runtime does not enforce). abap2UI5 lists them in
  `node/setup/abap_transpile.json`, in the same commit as the test.

  This repository transpiles those same sources and kept a hand-written
  SECOND COPY of that list. The copy is what broke the nightly on 2026-08-03
  (issue #63, `test_tab_ref_gen`) and again on 2026-09-02 (issue #84,
  `test_skip_sorted_table`): upstream added the test and its skip entry
  together, the clone here picked up the test and knew nothing about the
  entry, and the build went red on a test upstream had already declared
  unrunnable. The second time the skip entry was 57 minutes old.

  So the list is read from the clone `clone:core` already makes, never
  copied — same reasoning as the abaplint downport shim above. The checked-in
  `skip` array holds only entries upstream does NOT have; it is empty today
  and an empty array is the correct state, not an oversight. The one entry it
  used to carry alone — `ltcl_parser_test->parse_error`, noted "NodeJS 20 does
  not set position of parsing error" — was stale: the pipeline runs Node 22,
  the test passes, and skipping it had been hiding a green test for as long as
  nobody re-read the note.

  A missing or reshaped upstream list fails the build with a message naming
  the path, because a silent fall back to the local half would be the drift
  again, only quieter.

- **`ci/merge_downport_config.mjs`, and the near-empty
  `ci/abaplint-downport.jsonc` it completes.** Which abaplint rules run
  alongside `downport`, and which syntax version they judge against, is a fact
  about abap2UI5, not about this pipeline: the downport result here has to
  pass the same check as upstream's source. That is the same rule the
  `@abaplint/cli` pin follows under "Pins", and `ci/check-abaplint-pin.mjs`
  already enforces the version half of it.

  The rules half was a hand-written copy of upstream's
  `.github/abaplint/abap_702.jsonc` — and it had already drifted, unnoticed:
  upstream runs `xml_bom`, the copy did not. Nothing would ever have said so.

  So rules and syntax are read from the clone. The checked-in file keeps only
  what is genuinely this pipeline's — `global.files` and the dependency
  folder, whose paths are relative to `ci/` and mean nothing upstream — plus a
  `rules` object for local OVERRIDES, which is empty and correct that way. A
  moved or reshaped upstream config fails the build with the path in the
  message, for the same reason as the skip list above.

- **`ci/patch_init_order.mjs`**. The transpiler emits static imports of async
  modules; ES only guarantees they *start* in order, not that each finishes
  before the next starts. Cross-class references made during
  `class_constructor` go through `abap.Classes` and are invisible to the module
  graph. Node happens to work, webpack does not. Rewriting the imports to
  sequential top-level `await import(...)` makes the order deterministic
  everywhere.

- **The three historical spellings of the context class** in
  `ci/patch_diss_oref.mjs` (`z2ui5_cl_abap2ui5_context` →
  `z2ui5_cl_a2ui5_context` → `z2ui5_cl_ui5_util_context`) and the two target
  file names (`z2ui5_cl_core_srv_model` / `z2ui5_cl_ui5_srv_model`). This repo
  built against upstream's *current* main every night until the freeze, so a
  patch that knew only one name broke the daily build on the day upstream
  renamed — which is exactly what happened on 2026-08-12. Add new spellings,
  never replace old ones: a pin bump can cross any of the renames.

- **The browser smoke gate** (`tests/web.spec.js`, run before the deploy).
  Everything upstream of it can be green while the deployed page is blank: a
  bundling or initialization fault only shows when the bundle actually runs.
  It also caught the bootstrap-tag regex matching a string *inside* the
  preload, see the comment in `app/web.mjs`.

## Deploy

`build_web.yaml` deploys `./build` with `force_orphan: true`, so the published
repository is exactly what `./build` contains — files committed there by hand
are gone with the next run. Anything visitors should find ships from
`app/pages/` and the copy step in the workflow.

`BUILD_INFO.json` records what the deploy was built from (the pins, the UI5
release, this repository's commit) and is read by nobody. The old
`build-stamp.txt` went with the daily cron, its only reader.

## Frozen inputs

Until 2026-10-06 a daily cron rebuilt the demo from the *tip* of abap2UI5 and
samples (and the transpiler and abaplint cloned the tip of open-abap-core and
express-icf-shim on every run), and the page booted the *newest* UI5 from the
CDN's cachebuster URL. Every one of those could turn the demo red without a
change here, and did — more scheduled runs failed than passed in the weeks
before. The demo is now frozen on the last combination that deployed green
(2026-10-01):

- **`ci/pins.json`** holds every external input: the commit of abap2UI5,
  samples, open-abap-core and express-icf-shim, and the UI5 release.
  `ci/clone.mjs` fetches each source at exactly its commit (`npm run clone`);
  the transpiler and abaplint read open-abap-core / express-icf-shim from
  `deps/` instead of cloning them. `app/web.mjs` rewrites the bootstrap `src`
  to `https://sdk.openui5.org/<ui5>/resources/sap-ui-core.js`. The UI5 pin is
  the 1.136 long-term-maintenance line, so the CDN keeps serving it for years;
  abap2UI5 supports UI5 down to 1.71.
- **No schedule.** `build_web` runs on push to main (and deploys), on pull
  requests and by hand. A build of the same commit reads the same inputs.
- **No Dependabot.** `package-lock.json` decides every npm version (`npm ci`),
  actions are SHA-pinned, the runner is `ubuntu-24.04`, Node comes from
  `.nvmrc`.

To refresh the demo, change the pins (and, if needed, `@abaplint/cli` and the
`@abaplint/*` tooling) by hand in one pull request; `build_web` — unit tests and
the browser smoke — is the verdict. Do not reintroduce a schedule or a
branch-tip clone: the point of the freeze is that nothing moves on its own.

## Pins

`@abaplint/cli` is pinned exactly (no caret) to the version abap2UI5 itself
syntax-checks with — the downport result has to pass the same check as
upstream's source — at the abap2UI5 commit in `ci/pins.json`. Bump it together
with that pin, by hand. `ci/check-abaplint-pin.mjs`
(run by `npm run clone`, so every build sees it) fails when the pin falls out
of lockstep — the rule was prose only until the pin sat at 2.120.3 while
upstream had long resolved 2.120.33.
